"In this Python code, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful deep learning technique, in conjunction with the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect emotions in human facial expressions. The model directory already contains a pre-trained model boasting an impressive 94.74% accuracy. To achieve such remarkable precision, the model underwent training iterations of 100 or more times. You can employ the testing code alongside this trained model by simply specifying the model's path. The model was trained on the FER2013 dataset, renowned for its reputation as one of the most intricate datasets for emotion detection."
